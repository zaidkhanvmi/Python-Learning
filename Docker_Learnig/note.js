// Using Docker in Your Personal Projects:

// Multi-Container Applications: Docker allows you to easily run multiple services (e.g., MongoDB, Node.js, Nginx) as separate containers. This is perfect for full-stack applications like MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

// Rapid Deployment: Once you have a Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml, you can easily deploy your app to any platform (local server, cloud, etc.) by just running a few commands. You don't need to worry about setting up servers or dependencies.

// Image is the static template (read-only).
// Container is the running instance of the image (dynamic and can change).
